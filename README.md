# Urgency Print Lab / Artbook @ MoMAPS1 August 5, 2018

The act of downloading interrupts the normal, smooth flow of network culture. To download is to interrupt (and extend) circulation by storing a local copy! To disperse material, by making it downloadable, is to preserve it—you keep it safe by making copies that disconnect from the network. To download is to counter-publish.

Once downloaded, files are outside the conventions and economies of publishing, the art world, and the internet. On your local hard drive, you can interact with the work in any way desired. Urgencyprintlab.pdf was created on August 5, 2018 and published at X:XXpm during a workshop conducted by Paul Soulellis at Artbook @ MoMAPS1 in Long Island City, NY, USA. This file may be downloaded, shuffled, remixed, printed, re-circulated—even destroyed.
