# queer.archive.work (2018)

Printed Web 6 is queer.archive.work edited by Paul Soulellis. It launches at the NY Art Book Fair in September and the Boston Art Book Fair in October. We’ll use this moment to close out one project, and start a new one — the beginnings of a radical, queer archive (as yet unnamed)!

* It’s a signal sent out into muddy waters; 
* It’s the start of a speculative practice emerging from (moving into?) the undercommons — a collective place for subversive artists and writers who reject normative narratives;
* Printed Web 6 is an assembling of queer methodologies … 
* … with a particular view towards network culture, failure, and refutation; 
* It’s an attempt to move far beyond the printed web;
* it’s an experiment in publishing as artistic practice as resistance.
