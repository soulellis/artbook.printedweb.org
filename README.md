# Urgency Print Lab (2018)

Urgency Print Lab @ MoMA PS1 August 5, 2018 Downloading and printing are acts that interrupt the normal, smooth flow of network culture. To download is to interrupt circulation by storing a local copy. To disperse material, by making it downloadable, is to preserve it—you keep it safe by taking it off the network. To download is to counter-publish.

Once downloaded, files are outside the conventions and economies of publishing, the art world, and the internet. On your local hard drive, you can interact with the work in any way desired. Urgencyprintlab.pdf was created on August 5, 2018 during a workshop conducted by Paul Soulellis at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, NY, USA and published at X:XXpm. The material may be downloaded, shuffled, remixed, printed, re-circulated—even destroyed.
