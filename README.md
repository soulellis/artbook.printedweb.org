# Urgency Print Lab / Artbook @ MoMA PS1 Book Space / August 5, 2018

The smooth flow of network culture has been normalized.

Downloading and printing are good interruptions! To slow down the material and the overwhelming condition of flow. Small acts to resist dominant narratives.

And so to disperse material, by making it downloadable, is to preserve it—you keep it safe by making copies that disconnect from the network. To download is to counter-publish.

Once downloaded, files are outside the conventions and economies and flows of publishing and art. On your hard drive, you’re free to do whatever you like with your files. 

Urgencyprintlab.pdf was created on August 5, 2018 and published at X:XXpm during a workshop conducted by Paul Soulellis at Artbook @ MoMA PS1 Book Space in Long Island City, NY, USA. This file may be downloaded, shuffled, remixed, printed, re-circulated—even destroyed.
