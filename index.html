			The act of downloading interrupts the normal, smooth flow of network culture. To download is to interrupt (and extend) circulation by storing a local copy! To disperse material, by making it downloadable, is to preserve it&#8212;you keep it safe by making copies that disconnect from the network. To download is to counter-publish.</h2>
<br>
			<h2>Once downloaded, files are outside the conventions and economies of publishing, art, and internet worlds. On your local hard drive, you can interact with the work in any way desired.</h2>
