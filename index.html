			The act of downloading interrupts the normal, smooth flow of network culture. To download is to interrupt (and extend) circulation by storing a local copy! To disperse material, by making it downloadable, is to preserve it&#8212;you keep it safe by making copies that disconnect from the network. To download is to counter-publish.
<br>
<br>
<br>
			Once downloaded, files are outside the conventions and economies and flows of publishing and art. The material slows down. On your local hard drive, you can interact with the paused work in any way desired.
