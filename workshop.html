<br>
			A workshop in ten steps.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
			1&#8212;Take out your device. Set it to not go to sleep.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
			2&#8212;Choose one image from your camera roll to share with the group. <em>5</em>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
			3&#8212;Let&rsquo;s gather the devices together to take a look. <em>10</em>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
			4&#8212;Now, put your device away. 
<br>
			5&#8212;Take some time to think about the images and messages that you&rsquo;ve seen recently on the web. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
			<em>What stands out? 
<br>
			What&rsquo;s missing? 
<br>
			Who/what should be more visible? 
<br>
			Who/what do you wish you hadn&rsquo;t seen? 
<br>
			Who/what do you wish you could remember better?
<br>
			What&rsquo;s got value? 
<br>
			What&rsquo;s worth circulating?</em> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
			Write about the images and messages that you wish for. Be as specific as possible. <em>10</em> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

			6&#8212;Now, open your device to access the web.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
			7&#8212;Look for images and messages that should be slowed down and examined more closely. Search for urgent material. It could be a single tweet or image, or someone&rsquo;s entire feed. Make some selections and arrange them on your desktop. Feel free to incorporate your writing, too. <em>20</em>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
			8&#8212; Now let&rsquo;s scan and print! <em>20</em>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
			9&#8212; Cut, tape, draw, write, and collage the printed material onto 8.5 x 11 sheets. These will become the pages of our collaborative publication. <em>40</em>
